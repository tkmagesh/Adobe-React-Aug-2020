JavaScript
    Data Types
        number, string, boolean, object, function, undefined

    Programming Constructs
        var, if else, switch case, for, while, try catch finally, throw, function, typeof

    APIs
        Date, Array,  Math, timer (setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval), Error, RegEx

    Unique
        Object
            object is a dictionary (hash)
            is a collection of key/value pairs
            key can be a string or a number
            one key value pair is called as an attribute
            attributes can be accessed using the dot (.) notation or square brackets ([]) notation
            classes are not needed to create objects
            objects are dynamic
            a method in an object is just an attribute whose value is a function
            use the 'for..in' construct to iterate over all the attributes in an object

        Function
            Function can be treaded like objects
                functions can be created using the 'expression / literal' syntax
                functions can have attributes
                functions can have methods
                
                Higher Order Functions
                    functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
                    functions can be returned as return value from other functions
            
            implicit values -> this, arguments (array like object with all the values passed to the function as arguments)
            apply, bind & call are the built-in methods for functions

        Invocation Context (this)
            this
                - NOT based on WHERE the function is OR who owns the function
                - IS based on HOW the function is invoked


        Function Invocation Patterns
            If a function is invoked as a method of an object
                this -> object

            If a function is invoked as a function
                this -> global (window)

            Using the 'call' method of a function

            Using the 'apply' method of a function

            As a "Immediately Invoked Function Expression"

            Using 'new' keyword


Memoization
pure functions
    if the function execution can be replace with the result of the execution
    In other words , the function should not have any side effects


Constructor Functions
    Functions used like a 'class'
        invoked using the 'new' keyword
            - this -> new object
            - 'this' is returned by default

        As a convention, the constructor functions are named with a proper case


Inheritance
    Prototypal Inheritance

var products = [
    {id : 7, name : 'Pen', cost : 40, units : 30, category : 'stationary'},
    {id : 2, name : 'Ten', cost : 70, units : 20, category : 'grocery'},
    {id : 9, name : 'Den', cost : 20, units : 40, category : 'stationary'},
    {id : 4, name : 'Len', cost : 60, units : 50, category : 'stationary'},
    {id : 5, name : 'Zen', cost : 50, units : 30, category : 'grocery'}
]

Solve the following without using any looping constructs
(Hint : use filter, reduce, forEach and map methods of the array)
 
1. find all stationary products
2. create a new list of products with all existing the attributes and a new attribute called 'value' (where value = cost * units )
3. print the 'name' and 'value' of each product in the console
4. find the maximum cost from the products list
